<p>JB Race Media was founded by James in early<br>
2023. After success with his graphic design<br>
brand: JamesDesigns, he decided to go for a<br>
complete rebrand and create JB Race Media<br>
which has seen lots of success across<br>
different medias.<br>
<br>
James races himself so understands the <br>
need for a driver to have a good online <br>
identity to establish themself.
